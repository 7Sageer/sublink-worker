Here are the currently supported predefined rule sets:

|---|---|---|
| Ad Block | category-ads-all |  |
| AI Services | openai,anthropic,jetbrains-ai,perplexity |  |

The rule sets for Singbox are from [https://github.com/lyc8503/sing-box-rules](https://github.com/lyc8503/sing-box-rules), thanks to lyc8503 for the contribution!

## Custom Rules

In addition to using predefined rule sets, you can provide a list of custom rules in the `customRules` parameter as a JSON array. Each custom rule should contain the following fields:

- `sites`: Array of domain rules
- `ips`: Array of IP rules
- `domain_suffix`: Array of domain suffix rules
- `ip_cidr`: Array of IP CIDR rules
- `outbound`: Outbound name

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "sites": ["google", "anthropic"],
    "ips": ["private", "cn"],
    "domain_suffix": [".com", ".org"],
    "ip_cidr": ["192.168.0.0/16", "10.0.0.0/8"],
    "outbound": "ðŸ¤ª MyCustomRule"
  }
]
```

## Error Handling

The API will return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages when problems occur:

- 400 Bad Request: When required parameters are missing or invalid
- 404 Not Found: When the requested resource (such as a short URL) doesn't exist
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server-side errors

## Usage Notes

1. All proxy configurations in the `config` parameter should be URL-encoded.
2. Multiple proxy configurations can be included in a single request by separating them with newlines (`%0A`) in the URL-encoded `config` parameter.
3. When using custom rules, ensure that the rule names match exactly with those listed in the custom rules section.
4. Shortened URLs are intended for temporary use and may expire after a certain period.

## Examples

1. Generate a Sing-Box configuration with balanced rule set:
   ```
   /singbox?config=vmess%3A%2F%2Fexample&selectedRules=balanced
   ```

2. Generate a Clash configuration with custom rules:
   ```
   /clash?config=vless%3A%2F%2Fexample&customRules=%5B%7B%22sites%22%3A%5B%22example.com%22%5D%2C%22ips%22%3A%5B%22192.168.1.1%22%5D%2C%22domain_suffix%22%3A%5B%22.com%22%5D%2C%22ip_cidr%22%3A%5B%2210.0.0.0%2F8%22%5D%2C%22outbound%22%3A%22MyCustomRule%22%7D%5D
   ```

3. Shorten a URL:
   ```
   /shorten?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyour-worker-domain.workers.dev%2Fsingbox%3Fconfig%3Dvmess%253A%252F%252Fexample%26selectedRules%3Dbalanced
   ```
